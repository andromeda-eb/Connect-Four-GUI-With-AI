# Connect-Four-With-AI (09/20 - 09/20)
GUI Implementation of connect four in java using <strong>minimax with alpha-beta pruning</strong>.<br>
There are 3 difficulty settings: easy, medium and hard. Minimax searches 3, 5 and 8 <br> 
moves ahead respectively for each difficulty setting. The program can stall very slightly when<br>
the hardest difficulty is selected. This is because of all the different permutations of the <br>
players move on the board.
